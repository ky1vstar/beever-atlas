    every connection, de-registers its scheduler timers, and deletes all
    Mongo / Weaviate / graph / wiki / chat data behind an atomically-claimed
    purge lock (see :func:`beever_atlas.services.channel_deletion.purge_channel`).

    Order of checks (authz BEFORE everything else):

      1. ``assert_channel_delete_access`` — tenancy-aware destructive authz.
