# Beever Atlas Web

The Beever Atlas v2 web app — React/TypeScript frontend for the knowledge-memory platform.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A running Beever Atlas backend (see root README)

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm install` | Install dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Start Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173` with HMR |
| `npm test` | Run Vitest unit tests |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint across `src/` |
| `npm run build` | Production build into `dist/` (Vite bundles and tree-shakes) |

## Environment Variables

The web app reads env from the **root `.env`** (via Vite's `envDir`). There is no separate `web/.env` — edit the root file and the change applies to both `npm run dev` and Docker builds. See [`../.env.example`](../.env.example) §1.4 for the VITE_* vars.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Base URL of the backend API (default: `http://localhost:8000`) |
| `VITE_BEEVER_API_KEY` | Bearer token injected into every `/api/*` request |
| `VITE_BEEVER_ADMIN_TOKEN` | Admin token for `/api/dev/*` calls |

> **Note**: for `npm run dev` / `npm run build` these come from the root `.env`
> at build time. In the **Docker image** they are injected at *runtime* instead:
> the bundle is built with `__VITE_*__` placeholders and [`env.sh`](./env.sh)
> (run from `/docker-entrypoint.d/`) rewrites them from the container's
> environment on boot — so one image serves every environment and you configure
> it via Docker `-e` / compose `environment:` (no rebuild). Either way these
> values are visible in the browser bundle — treat `VITE_BEEVER_API_KEY` as a
> low-privilege read-only key.

## Project Layout
